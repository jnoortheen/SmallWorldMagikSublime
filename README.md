Syntax Highlight for GE Smallworld Magik Language in sublime text. 

Copy the .tmLanguage file to ./packages/User directory (From Sublime text menu bar Preferences-> Browse Packages) to get syntax highlighting.

Note: This may work with TextMate and similar editors which support .tmLanguage format.
